# ANSI Animation in a terminal using Haskell

[![GitHub issues][issues-img]][issues] [![License: The Unlicense][license-img]][license]

Written as a homework assignment for Emurgo's Haskell Development Professional course, this trivial Haskell program may be further developed as my familiarity with the language grows.

**NOTE**: This repo uses my own highly opinionated development environment which takes advantage of the following:

- [NixOS/Nix](https://nixos.org/)
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

I'll attempt to update this list if/when my chosen environmental control mechanisms change.
